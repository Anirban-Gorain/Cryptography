START
------------------------------------
STEP 1 : Take user choice Encryption or Decryption. If Decryption then go STEP 11. If Encryption then go the STEP 3 if USER can’t enter both the values then  go STEP 2 .
STEP 2 : Show eroor message  and close the program .
STEP 3 : Take Encryption’s data and store it in a array.
STEP 4 :  Take is user’s key and and store it in a array.
STEP 8 : Perform bitwise XOR between every chracter of Encryption's value and key and put the result on particular Encryption's value's array.
STEP 9 : Put the encryption's data in a file.
STEP 10 : Show it "Your encryption copmplete. Must remember key if you lost your key you can't decrypt your data."
 STEP 11 : Show two message Decrypt Data from file or enter data manualy if Decrypt Data from file then go Step 12, if enter data manualy then go to teh STEP 16.
STEP 12 : Show "Enter your Encryppted value";
STEP 13 : Show "Enter your key (Remember! if you enter wrong key you get a wrong value.)".
STEP 14 : Perform bitwise XOR between every chracter of Encrypted value and key and print on the same time.
STEP 15 : show "DONE".
STEP 16: Show message "Enter your key" and store it.
STEP 17: Get data from encrypted file one by one and store in a variable and perform bitwise XOR between it variable and key and print same time.
STEP 18:  show "Decryption Complete".
STEP 19: Show "Thank You".
STEP 20: Close program.
